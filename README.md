# Full Stack JavaScript Project 6
For this project, I created a personal portfolio website using Node, Express and Pug.

## The Brief
In this project, you'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects you've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five projects from this Techdegree.

You'll create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects you've created.

You'll use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

You'll use Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project

## Exceeds Expectations Requirements
The command 'npm start' runs the app.

Error specific pug templates are fully functional.

The style has been customised (nav bar background, font colours and sidebar font and background colours).

## Outcome
Everything is functioning as per the brief and exceeded grade requirements.
